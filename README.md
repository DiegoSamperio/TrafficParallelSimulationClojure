# TrafficParallelSimulationClojure
 traffic simulation in Clojure that models vehicle flow at a crossroad using parallel programming to optimize performance by approximately 25%. The program processes car arrival data and traffic logic from text files, calculates average waiting times, and tracks dead time for each lane and traffic light.
